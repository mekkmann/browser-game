Fun challenge, I got to learn many new things!

This was the first project I started, mostly to get a feel for GameDev in js and the browser.

#### How to Start the App:
1. git clone https://github.com/mekkmann/browser-game 
2. cd browser-game => click on tab => hit enter
3. open . OR manually navigate to the folder
4. open index.html

Done!
